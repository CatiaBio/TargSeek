# QuickGO Protein Annotation Data

This folder contains protein annotation data downloaded from [QuickGO](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/annotations). Specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms were selected to identify and retrieve proteins located within defined bacterial cell compartments, including:

- Cell outer membrane
- Peptidoglycan-based cell wall
- Gram-negative-bacterium-type cell wall
- External encapsulating structures
- Structural components associated with the bacterial cell wall

## Purpose

The dataset is intended to facilitate bioinformatics analyses of bacterial proteins localized in specific cellular structures, potentially identifying suitable targets for antibody development or other biomedical applications.

## Data Source

Data was retrieved from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) QuickGO resource:

GO:0009288	Fimbriae	Short, hair-like structures aiding in bacterial adhesion.
GO:0009289	Pilus	Long filamentous structures used for adhesion or conjugation.

ðŸ§± Cell Wall & Membrane Types
GO ID	Name	Description
GO:0009273	Gram-positive cell wall	Thick peptidoglycan layer with teichoic acids; lacks outer membrane.
GO:0009274	Peptidoglycan-based cell wall	Common to all bacteria; provides rigidity and shape.
GO:0009275	Gram-negative cell wall	Thin peptidoglycan layer between inner and outer membranes.
GO:0009276	Gram-negative-bacterium-type cell wall	Specific term for Gram-negative wall structure, similar to above.
GO:0009279	Cell outer membrane	Specific outer membrane found in Gram-negative bacteria.

ðŸ§¬ Transport & Permeability
GO ID	Name	Description
GO:0015288	Porin activity	Channel proteins forming pores in the outer membrane.
GO:0046930	Pore complex	Multi-protein assemblies that form selective pores across membranes.

ðŸ’¥ Toxins & Biosynthesis
GO ID	Name	Description
GO:0090729	Toxin activity	Proteins that damage or disrupt host functions.
GO:0009425	Lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic process	Assembly of LPS â€” a major antigen in Gram-negative bacteria.
GO:0010339	Cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis	Creation of complex sugars for the cell wall and capsule.
